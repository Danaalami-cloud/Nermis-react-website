                <h4> It all started with an addiction, I've always been in love with skincare products, all kinds, and different brands.
Body creams, hand lotions can be found in every room in my house, along with lip balms in my handbag and on the kitchen counter, next to the bed and just every where. I used to spend lots of money on brands, but I not always satisfied with the results.
So, I got to the point that maybe I can make my own cream or lotion out of ingredients of my choice.
I've been going through books, videos and tutorials on how to DIY skincare products; I learned a lot about how to choose oils and butters, and about making different kinds of soap bars, body butters, lip balms, shampoo bars â€¦ and many more .
Not only was it (and still is )a joy to make my own needs of products, but I'm also very satisfied with every result I get after use.
It gives me a Pleasure sharing my hand made skincare treats  with people I love and care about.</h4>
